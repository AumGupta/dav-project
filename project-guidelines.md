# DAV Project

Project : Students are required to work on a good dataset in consultation with their faculty and apply the concepts learned in the course. Each project must include the following:

1. Download a dataset (Either web-scrap the data from various data sources like twitter, amazon, news sites or
download a dataset from kaggle/UCI/data.gov.in etc.). Select a dataset which requires at least two steps of data
cleaning and two steps of data pre-processing.

2. Make an objective of the data analysis for that dataset. Depending on the dataset, perform the data cleaning, data
pre-processing steps.

3. The data cleaning steps may include handling of missing values, handling duplicate data, handling inconsistent data (e.g. height is given in feet for some objects and in inches in some other objects), removing redundant data
(e.g. in some datasets, age and date of birth are given as two column while the analysis needs only the age),
handling incomplete data (e.g. email address doesn't have @ symbol).

4. The pre-processing steps may include transforming the data to some other format (e.g text comment converted to
term vector, image files converted to various types of features), discretization and binning (Group/Categorization),
standardization/normalization and outlier detection. Some string manipulations may also be required.

5. Prepare at least eight analysis questions for exploration of the data and at least two questions for the visualization of the data. (10 Questions)
